Material Design for Bootstrap is the best way to use [Material Design guidelines by Google](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) 
in your Bootstrap 4 based application.  Since this is a fully customizable version of Bootstrap,
just include Material Design for Bootstrap CSS instead of Bootstrap CSS, and include the JavaScript at 
the end of your document (just before the `</body>` tag), and everything will be converted to Material Design.
